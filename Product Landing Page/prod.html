                <p>The first time you hold the COOLPIX B700, you'll know it's an exceptional camera. Its DSLR-style design, including a PSAM mode dial, puts key controls where you want them and feels great in your hands. The first time you zoom in with it, you'll wonder if any shot will ever be out of reach again. Subjects barely visible to the naked eye come into tight focus, held steady by cutting-edge Vibration Reduction technology. Use that power to capture stunning 20.2 megapixel RAW images, 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) videos with stereo sound or 5 FPS high-speed sequences in nearly any light. Plus, the whole time you're shooting, the COOLPIX B700 can be connected to a compatible smartphone through Bluetooth® Low Energy (BLE) technology for instant photo sharing and remote camera control. This is more than a compact camera—it's a creative powerhouse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The COOLPIX B700 is a serious movie-making tool. Create with the awe-inspiring resolution of 4K Ultra HD (3840x2160) and selectable 30p or 25p frame rates. Face-priority AF keeps focus where you want it, and 5-Axis Hybrid Vibration Reduction (VR) keeps videos tripod-steady. High fidelity audio is captured with a stereo zoom mic that changes directivity according to zoom operation. Record up to 8 minutes with the touch of a button, then quickly delete unwanted footage right in the camera. 
                </p>
                <p>The COOLPIX B700's large, LCD display makes it easy to compose your shots or monitor your video recording. Reviewing and sharing your creations is a pleasure, too—every shot looks fantastic on the display.</p>
                <p>Creative Mode makes it easy to create artistic photos and videos, right in the camera. Capture fireworks like never before with Multiple Exposure Lighten, which combines multiple shots into one amazing image. Turn a sequence of action into a fast-paced video with Superlapse and much more.</p>
